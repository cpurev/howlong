              <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Chuluunbat, or Chuka, and I'm an aspiring software engineer. 
                Growing up in Mongolia my father owned an Internet Cafe (a relic of its time, nowadays only gaming ones exist) where it was just me and him working there. 
                We did everything that has to do with computers from running the place to, formating computers, building PCs, troubleshooting, and selling PC parts.</p>
              <p>It was natural for me to pursue a degree in Computer Science and choose a career in IT industry. During my time at university, I had opportunity to work and explore specific areas of Computer Science.
                I have learned and have experience in working on Machine Learning, Cryptography, and DevOps.
              </p>
              <p>I will be graduating from my university in April, 2023. So </p>
              <p>Here are some things that I spend my time on:</p>

            <h2>{ Get In Touch }</h2>
            <p>As a recent graduate, I am eager to take the next step in my career and continue learning.  Currently, I'm open to any position in any city in America. 
              Please feel free to contact me if you have an opportuniy that you believe would be a good fit for me. I am always excited to explore new challenges and technologies.
